Requirement: Commiting changes in Nagios plugins from Github should be autodeployed on Nagios server.


Setup:

Create 1st EC2 as server1
   -- Install NagiosXI on it
   -- Install Jenkins on it
Create 2nd EC2 as server2
   -- Install Ansible on it.
   
Establish SSH connectivity between Jenkins and Ansible Server

On Jenkins create pipeline and integrate GitHub, Ansible
Create webhook in GitHub and itegrate it with Jenkins for auto-run Jenkins Jobs.


Thanks!!!
